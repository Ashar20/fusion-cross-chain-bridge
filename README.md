# 🌉 Fusion Cross-Chain Bridge

> **Revolutionary cross-chain atomic swaps between Ethereum and EOS using 1inch Fusion+ technology**

## 🎯 **Project Vision**

Extending 1inch Fusion+ to support non-EVM blockchains, starting with EOS. This enables gasless, intent-based cross-chain swaps with atomic guarantees.

## 🚀 **Current Status**

🔬 **Research Phase** - Implementing Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLC) for atomic cross-chain swaps

### **Planned Features**
- ⚡ Atomic swaps between Ethereum and EOS  
- 🤖 1inch Fusion+ resolver integration
- 🧩 Partial fill support for large orders
- 🛡️ Security-first architecture with time-locked refunds

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

```
Ethereum (EVM)     ←→     EOS (Non-EVM)
    ├─ HTLC Contract         ├─ HTLC Contract  
    ├─ Fusion+ Integration   ├─ Native Actions
    └─ Resolver Network      └─ Cross-chain Sync
```

## 🎯 **Innovation Target**

**1inch Fusion+ Extension Bounty** - First integration with non-EVM blockchain
