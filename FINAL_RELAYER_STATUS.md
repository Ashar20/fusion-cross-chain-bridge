# 🎉 FINAL RELAYER STATUS - ERROR FIXED!

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')` has been **successfully fixed**!

### 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

**Problem**: In the `analyzeDutchAuctionPricing` function, when the order was still at original price, the function returned early without calculating the `profitMargin`, causing the error when trying to call `toFixed()` on undefined.

**Solution**: Modified the function to calculate profitability even for orders at original price, ensuring `profitMargin` is always defined.
