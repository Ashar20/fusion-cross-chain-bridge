# 🎯 **RESOLVER WALLET/ADDRESS MANAGEMENT**

## 📋 **OVERVIEW**

Yes, you're absolutely correct! The enhanced resolvers will have their own wallets/addresses for handling transactions. Here's how the wallet management system works across all components:

---

## 🏗️ **ENHANCED CROSS-CHAIN RESOLVER WALLETS**

### **📜 EnhancedCrossChainResolver.sol (647 lines)**

#### **🔐 Resolver Authorization System**
```solidity
// Each resolver has its own address for handling transactions
mapping(address => bool) public authorizedResolvers;
mapping(address => uint256) public resolverBalances;

// Resolver wallet management
modifier onlyAuthorizedResolver() {
    require(authorizedResolvers[msg.sender], "Not authorized resolver");
    _;
}
```

#### **💰 Resolver Fee Tracking**
```solidity
// Each resolver wallet tracks its own fees
struct CrossChainOrder {
    // ... other fields ...
    address winningResolver;    // Resolver wallet that won the auction
    uint256 winningBid;        // Amount bid by resolver wallet
}

// Resolver balances tracked per wallet
mapping(address => uint256) public resolverBalances;
```

#### **🎯 Resolver Wallet Functions**
```solidity
// Resolvers execute transactions from their own wallets
function executePartialFill(
    bytes32 _orderHash,
    uint256 _fillAmount,
    bytes32 _secret,
    uint256 _algorandAmount
) external onlyAuthorizedResolver {
    // Resolver wallet pays gas and executes the fill
    // Resolver wallet earns fees for successful execution
}

function placeBid(
    bytes32 _orderHash,
    uint256 _bidAmount
) external onlyAuthorizedResolver {
    // Resolver wallet places bid in Dutch auction
    // Resolver wallet competes with other resolver wallets
}
```

## 🧩 **ALGORAND PARTIAL FILL BRIDGE WALLETS**

### **📱 AlgorandPartialFillBridge.py (400+ lines)**

#### **🔐 Resolver Wallet Management**
```python
class AlgorandPartialFillBridge:
    def __init__(self, algod_client, creator_address, creator_private_key):
        self.algod_client = algod_client
        self.creator_address = creator_address      # Creator wallet
        self.creator_private_key = creator_private_key
        self.app_id = None
```

#### **💰 Resolver Fee Tracking**
```python
# Local state keys for resolver wallets
resolver_fees = Bytes("resolver_fees")      # Per-resolver fee tracking
resolver_fills = Bytes("resolver_fills")    # Per-resolver fill tracking

def handle_resolver_withdrawal():
    """Handle resolver wallet withdrawals"""
    return Seq([
        # Resolver wallet can withdraw earned fees
        # Each resolver has its own local state
        App.localPut(Txn.sender(), resolver_fees, Int(0)),
        # Transfer fees to resolver wallet
    ])
```

#### **🎯 Resolver Wallet Functions**
```python
def execute_partial_fill(self, fill_amount, secret, resolver_private_key):
    """Execute partial fill using resolver wallet"""
    # resolver_private_key = Resolver's private key
    # Resolver wallet pays Algorand fees
    # Resolver wallet earns fees for successful execution

def place_dutch_bid(self, bid_amount, resolver_private_key):
    """Place Dutch auction bid using resolver wallet"""
    # resolver_private_key = Resolver's private key
    # Resolver wallet competes in auction
    # Resolver wallet pays bid amount
```

## 🔐 **RESOLVER ADDRESS MANAGER WALLETS**

### **📡 ResolverAddressManager.sol**

#### **🎯 Individual Resolver Wallets**
```solidity
struct ResolverAddress {
    address resolverAddress;     // Generated wallet for this resolver
    address ownerAddress;        // Original owner wallet
    uint256 nonce;              // Unique nonce for wallet generation
    bool active;                // Whether this wallet is active
    uint256 totalFees;          // Total fees earned by this wallet
    uint256 totalFills;         // Total fills executed by this wallet
    string resolverName;        // Human-readable name
}
```

#### **🔐 Wallet Generation Process**
```solidity
function createResolverAddress(
    string calldata _resolverName,
    bytes calldata _ownerSignature
) external payable returns (address resolverAddress) {
    // Generate unique wallet address for this resolver
    resolverAddress = _generateDeterministicAddress(msg.sender, nextNonce);
    
    // Create wallet record with tracking
    resolverAddresses[resolverAddress] = ResolverAddress({
        resolverAddress: resolverAddress,  // New wallet address
        ownerAddress: msg.sender,          // Owner wallet
        // ... other fields
    });
}
```

#### **💰 Wallet Fee Tracking**
```solidity
function recordFeeEarned(address _resolverAddress, uint256 _amount) external {
    // Track fees earned by specific resolver wallet
    ResolverAddress storage resolver = resolverAddresses[_resolverAddress];
    resolver.totalFees += _amount;
    emit FeeEarned(_resolverAddress, _amount, resolver.totalFees);
}
```

## 🎯 **RESOLVER WALLET TYPES**

### **🏗️ CONTRACT-BASED RESOLVER WALLETS**
```solidity
// Each resolver contract has its own address
CrossChainHTLCResolver: 0x343E44b629fcd1E97Fd787D0f60F39F8FEA123eE
Enhanced1inchStyleBridge: 0xBc79b64D896C4c94FA0cB52cdc4fbFb5A89E3225
SimpleHTLC: 0x583F57CA7b2AEdaF2A34480C70BD22764d72AaD2
```

### **🔐 GENERATED RESOLVER WALLETS**
```javascript
// Each resolver gets its own generated wallet
const resolvers = [
    {
        name: "High-Frequency-Resolver-1",
        walletAddress: "[Generated]", // Unique wallet for this resolver
        description: "High-frequency trading resolver for fast execution"
    },
    {
        name: "Arbitrage-Resolver-1", 
        walletAddress: "[Generated]", // Unique wallet for this resolver
        description: "Arbitrage resolver for price differences"
    },
    {
        name: "MEV-Resolver-1",
        walletAddress: "[Generated]", // Unique wallet for this resolver
        description: "MEV resolver for sandwich attacks"
    },
    {
        name: "Backup-Resolver-1",
        walletAddress: "[Generated]", // Unique wallet for this resolver
        description: "Backup resolver for redundancy"
    }
];
```

## 🔧 **WALLET MANAGEMENT FEATURES**

### **📊 Wallet Tracking**
```solidity
// Track each resolver wallet individually
mapping(address => uint256) public resolverBalances;     // ETH balances
mapping(address => uint256) public totalFees;            // Total fees earned
mapping(address => uint256) public totalFills;           // Total fills executed
mapping(address => bool) public authorizedResolvers;     // Authorization status
```

### **🔐 Wallet Security**
```solidity
// Security features for resolver wallets
modifier onlyAuthorizedResolver() {
    require(authorizedResolvers[msg.sender], "Not authorized resolver");
    _;
}

// Owner can deactivate/reactivate resolver wallets
function setAuthorizedResolver(address _resolver, bool _authorized) external onlyOwner
```

### **💰 Wallet Economics**
```solidity
// Fee structure for resolver wallets
uint256 public resolverFeeRate = 50;        // 0.5% fee rate
uint256 public partialFillBonus = 25;       // 0.25% bonus for partial fills

// Cost structure
uint256 public constant ADDRESS_GENERATION_COST = 0.001 ether;  // Wallet creation cost
```

## 🎯 **RESOLVER WALLET INTEGRATION**

### **🔗 Cross-Chain Wallet Coordination**
```javascript
// Ethereum Side
const ethResolverWallet = "0x[Generated]";  // Resolver wallet on Ethereum
const ethResolverBalance = await enhancedResolver.getResolverBalance(ethResolverWallet);

// Algorand Side
const algoResolverWallet = "[Generated]";   // Resolver wallet on Algorand
const algoResolverState = await bridge.get_resolver_state(algoResolverWallet);
```

### **🤖 Relayer Integration**
```javascript
// Relayer wallets handle gas fees
ETH Relayer: 0x58924acDe600D5a0Fb3fb0AF49c8FE02060F79Ea
ALGO Relayer: BJDBVZITI7VRHJLMPY4C6BX5UVBHZVNT6PRD3ZZWO2E2HSDYGSF4KO6RR4

// Resolver wallets handle execution
Resolver Wallet: [Generated for each resolver]
```
